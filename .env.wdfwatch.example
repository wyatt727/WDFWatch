# WDFwatch (automated account) OAuth 2.0 Configuration
# 
# ⚠️ OPTIONAL: This file is OPTIONAL - you can put everything in .env instead!
# 
# This separate file exists only if you want extra safety by separating
# WDFwatch tokens from other credentials. If you prefer simplicity,
# just put WDFWATCH_ACCESS_TOKEN and WDFWATCH_REFRESH_TOKEN in .env.
#
# Usage (only if you want this extra safety):
#   cp .env.wdfwatch.example .env.wdfwatch
# 
# This file is automatically generated by scripts/generate_wdfwatch_tokens.py
# but you can also create it manually with the values below.

# Twitter App Credentials (from your Twitter Developer Portal)
# These are required for OAuth 2.0 token generation and refresh
CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here

# OAuth 2.0 tokens (obtained via setup_oauth2.py or generate_wdfwatch_tokens.py)
# These tokens are account-specific and allow posting as @WDFwatch
WDFWATCH_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
WDFWATCH_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token_here
WDFWATCH_TOKEN_TYPE=bearer
WDFWATCH_EXPIRES_IN=7200
WDFWATCH_SCOPE="tweet.write users.read tweet.read offline.access"

# Optional: API Keys for OAuth 1.0a compatibility (compound format)
# Only needed if you have legacy code that requires OAuth 1.0a
# Format: consumer_key:consumer_secret
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
API_KEY_SECRET=your_api_key_secret_here

# Token refresh timestamp (automatically updated by token_manager.py)
