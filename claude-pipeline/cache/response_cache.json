    "response": "Based on my examination of the responder module, here's a comprehensive analysis:\n\n## WDF Responder Module Analysis\n\n### Structure & Components\n\nThe responder module is part of a specialized AI pipeline system for the \"War, Divorce, or Federalism\" (WDF) podcast's social media engagement. It consists of:\n\n1. **Configuration File**: `/specialized/responder/CLAUDE.md` - Contains detailed instructions for tweet response generation\n2. **Pipeline Integration**: `stages/respond.py` - Python implementation that uses the configuration\n3. **Orchestrator Integration**: `orchestrator.py` - Manages the responder as part of the full pipeline\n\n### Key Features\n\n**Response Generation Capabilities:**\n- Generates tweet replies under 240 characters\n- Includes podcast URLs (YouTube links or @WDF_Show handle)\n- References episode-specific content and guests\n- Uses relevance context to craft targeted responses\n- Maintains provocative but respectful tone for constitutional/federalism topics\n\n**Batch Processing:**\n- Processes up to 20 tweets per batch for efficiency\n- Handles duplicate conversation filtering\n- Validates response length and content\n- Falls back to individual processing if batch fails\n\n**Quality Controls:**\n- Mandatory character limits (240-250 chars)\n- Emoji removal and content validation\n- Response regeneration if too long\n- No @username inclusion (Twitter handles automatically)\n\n### Integration Points\n\n**Episode Context System:**\n- Uses `EPISODE_CONTEXT.md` files for episode-specific memory\n- Loads video URLs from episode directories\n- Integrates with classification results to only respond to relevant tweets\n\n**Web UI Integration:**\n- Syncs responses to PostgreSQL database when `WDF_WEB_MODE=true`\n- Creates draft replies for human moderation workflow\n- Maintains file-based backup for backward compatibility\n\n**Pipeline Stages:**\n1. Loads relevant tweets from classification stage\n2. Sets episode context with summary and video URL\n3. Processes tweets in batches with detailed prompts\n4. Saves responses to episode directory\n5. Syncs to database for web UI moderation\n\n### Safety Features\n\n**Content Guidelines:**\n- Focuses on constitutional federalism themes\n- Avoids evaluative language (\"Perfect!\", \"Excellent\")\n- No assistant-like phrases (\"I'll\", \"Let me\")\n- No meta-commentary about the generation process\n\n**Error Handling:**\n- Never outputs error messages to users\n- Always generates valid responses even when issues occur\n- Falls back to individual processing if batch fails\n- Maintains strict character limits through validation\n\n### Example Response Pattern\n\nFor a tweet about federal overreach:\n```\nOriginal Tweet: \"The federal government is out of control!\"\nResponse: \"Sheriff Mack exposed how YOUR county sheriff can arrest federal agents violating the Constitution. Rick Becker's WDF episode reveals 376 sheriffs already refusing unconstitutional orders: https://youtube.com/episode\"\n```\n\nThe system is well-designed for automated social media engagement while maintaining quality controls and human oversight capabilities.

    "response": "I can see you're reading a temporary prompt file for the summarizer. This file contains instructions for generating keywords for tweet discovery based on an episode summary, but it shows there was an error in the summarization process.\n\nThe file shows:\n- A request to generate 60-70 keywords for finding relevant tweets\n- An error message indicating \"Summary generation failed\" with \"Summary too short: 0 characters\"\n- A placeholder summary was created to allow the pipeline to continue\n\nThe summarization appears to have failed, which means the keyword generation stage couldn't proceed with actual episode content. This is likely why you're seeing this temp file - it's part of the pipeline's error handling to preserve the failed request.\n\nIs there something specific you'd like me to help you with regarding this summarization error or the pipeline process?",
