Rick Becker: Welcome to War, Divorce, or Federalism. Today we're talking about state sovereignty and the constitutional framework that our founders intended.

Guest: Thank you for having me, Rick. The issue of federalism is more critical than ever. We're seeing unprecedented federal overreach that the founders would have never imagined.

Rick Becker: Absolutely. The 10th Amendment is clear - powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states and the people. But we've seen that principle eroded over decades.

Guest: Exactly. Take the recent rulings on interstate commerce. The federal government is using the commerce clause to justify regulations that have nothing to do with actual interstate commerce. This is exactly what nullification and interposition were designed to address.

Rick Becker: For our listeners who might not be familiar, can you explain the concept of nullification?

Guest: Nullification is the idea that states have the right and duty to nullify federal laws that exceed constitutional authority. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison outlined this principle in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798.

Rick Becker: And this ties directly into our show's premise - we're facing a choice between war, divorce, or federalism. The peaceful solution is to return to true constitutional federalism.

Guest: That's right. The alternative is either violent conflict or peaceful separation. But if we can restore the balance of power between federal and state governments, we can preserve the union while protecting individual liberty.

Rick Becker: This episode has been about reclaiming state sovereignty through constitutional means. Thanks for joining us on War, Divorce, or Federalism.
