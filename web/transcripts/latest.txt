Tom Walls (00:00)
There's no mandatory taxes and you won't go to jail for not paying taxes because there are no obligatory ones. Now you can contribute voluntarily and the more merits you accumulate, the more weight your vote has. So it's a weighted voting system.

where if you've done a lot for the country, if you've contributed or worked a lot, then you have a lot of merits and you have a larger say ⁓ in the governance of the country. But everybody has one vote when it comes to vetoing something. We have the public veto. And if the majority of people don't like a person in office or if they don't like a law, they can rescind that through the plebiscite. And it's a pretty good system. And again, you can't vote to tax

your fellow citizens.

Rick Becker (01:15)
what happens when a group of libertarians claim a no man's land on the Danube and starts issuing passports, building embassies and trading in crypto? You get Liberland, a micro nation that's more real than its critics want to admit and more dangerous to the global order than most people realize. Tom Walls is the foreign minister for the free Republic of Liberland, the world's first libertarian startup nation.

this episode we ask can a tiny patch of land in Eastern Europe really shake the foundations of centralized empires and maybe more importantly should it? Tom, welcome!

Tom Walls (01:49)
Thank you, thank you Rick, it's great to be on.

Rick Becker (01:52)
I enjoyed meeting you at a conference recently and I am so happy that you graciously accepted the invite for this interview. I have been intrigued with Liberland since I first heard about it ⁓ probably close to a decade ago. And ⁓ I've got a lot of questions I'd like to ask but really we should probably set the foundation because a lot of people have not heard of Liberland they so so if you would set the table for us. Let our viewers know what what is this thing called Liberland?

Tom Walls (02:20)
Okay, Liberland is a new country. The Free Republic of Liberland was founded about 10 years ago on April 13th, 2015. Now, some of you may know that that's Thomas Jefferson's birthday and that was done on purpose. Jefferson and many of the United States founding fathers were direct inspirations for the formation of Liberland. And, you know, it's,

by taking these ideas, these classical liberal ideas that inspired the American Revolution and the founding of the United States that also inspired us. ⁓ They weren't the only inspiration, but they were certainly a large part of it. And we've been around for 10 years now and we're stronger than ever and we're certainly not going away. I think you alluded to in the introduction that

we're existing and we're much more successful than our opponents may like to admit.

Rick Becker (03:19)
Yeah, it's interesting to me in doing a little research for this interview, getting to that idea of this is more real than your opponents want to admit it sounds like they are concerned enough that they're sabotaging with with hacking and certainly denying entry if they can on the Croatian side denying entry to to the land. So this this land is I forget is it like 7000 acres?

Tom Walls (03:47)
No, it's actually fairly small. As far as the total number of acres, I'd have to look that up, but it's about three and a half square miles or seven square kilometers. And it's a pretty fair size. Once you've been in it, you realize, wow, this is a pretty big place. And it's bigger than other countries. It's bigger than Monaco, for example. It's bigger than Vatican City. It's on par with Gibraltar and a few other smaller nations.

Yeah, they've put some obstacles in our way, but we have people there and we've had people there for the last two years. On August 6th, that'll be our second anniversary of actually having access to the land. For eight years, we couldn't even go there without getting arrested by the Croatians. But in August 2023, they decided to allow people to go in for visits and even staying over.

We've built a community there and around Liberland as well. I live on the other side of the river on the Serbian side. We have a village called Ark Liberland Village, Ark, A-R-K. And I have a cabin there. I'm there probably 75 % of the time. At the moment I'm at my home in Florida, United States, but I spend most of my time over there.

Rick Becker (05:02)
Interesting. So this this patch of land that is liberal and claim liberal and is is in the Dan on the Danube between Croatia and Serbia, correct. And, and neither they have a lot of territorial disputes, but neither side for whatever reason, I guess they overlooked it never claimed this piece of property. And so a very enterprising young man libertarian minded, ⁓ and I'm not going to get his name right. So I'll let you pronounce it for us. A Czech citizen.

Tom Walls (05:12)
Yes, that's right.

Rick Becker (05:29)
said, Hey, you know what, ⁓ we could maybe set up a ⁓ sort of a, a free utopia, if you will. And tell us more about that.

Tom Walls (05:40)
Yep, Vít Jedlička, Jedlička, J-E-D-L-I-C-K-A, and a few other ⁓ people, libertarians from the Czech Republic, ⁓ basically saw the increasing amount of taxes and regulations that the Czech Republic was adopting after they joined the EU. So, and basically they started ⁓ a political party and it didn't get too far.

And people told them, if you don't like the way things are, why don't you start your own country? And that's what they did. So they looked up what land on the earth is not claimed by any other country. And there happened to be one piece of land in Europe, which was fairly accessible, that they went to and planted a flag there. Now there's a few other pieces of land around the world that are also unclaimed by other countries formally. There's a patch of land between Egypt and Sudan.

but the climate is very inhospitable. It's in a dusty, dry desert mountainous area. And, you know, it's, there's a dispute between those two countries, Egypt and Sudan, about who owns it. It's called Virtaweel. Some other people have claimed that, but again, it's very inaccessible and it's not really a nice place to live. Also parts of Antarctica are not really claimed by any other country. There's a few...

know, research stations and a few other ⁓ footholds there that some countries have. But again, who wants to live in Antarctica? ⁓ Liberland is right on the Danube River and it's beautiful place. It's beautiful riverine forest and of course that's where a lot of the cruise ships go by. You can take a Danube River cruise and maybe start out in Vienna and go down to Budapest and all the way down to Novi Sad and Belgrade and we see a of cruise ships going by just about every day.

Rick Becker (07:35)
Huh, that's that's very interesting. I love that concept. I it actually makes me want to take a cruise down the Danube just so I can see with my own eyes, Liberland. So

Tom Walls (07:45)
One of the cruise

companies does point out, hey, everybody, there's this piece of land right here on the right side, on the right river bank that is neglected by its neighbors, but these other people have claimed it and they called it Liberland. So we are part of the tour. The tour guides do include us in the sightseeing on the Danube cruise tours.

Rick Becker (08:03)
Yeah.

Yeah. So a couple more things just to like I said, as I say, set the table now. ⁓ So you've gained access in the last couple of years, because the Croatians were preventing there's a whole drama with that over the last few years. ⁓ Have Are buildings erected yet on Liberland?

Tom Walls (08:20)
Sure.

We erected several buildings ⁓ in about a month after they opened the border. And unfortunately, some of the Croatian ⁓ forest administration personnel came in and destroyed it. The police came in and separated us from our belongings and the buildings. And the guys came in with chainsaws and a truck to haul everything away. So the buildings that we built on the mainland of Liberland, they destroyed. ⁓ And we also were...

building a concrete building there and they came in with a backhoe and destroyed that. However, on Liberty Island, which is also part of Liberland, it's right on the Danube, we built a couple of structures there and they didn't touch them. ⁓ We're building tree houses there now and we're building a beach bar on that. We found out that's a place where they can't really access too easily with vehicles, so they tend to leave us alone there and they know it's not theirs.

the excuse they officially gave when they tore down our buildings was well we're cleaning up the forest here and ⁓ you know you guys have to let us do that and ⁓ it's not even croatia so our question is ⁓ where do they get the authority to come in and do that now we have face them in court in croatian courts about various fines and violations that they tried to get us on they were thrown out of court because

Judge said, well, this isn't even our jurisdiction. So how can we prosecute this case? And we've tried to sue them in Croatian court, both the prosecutor and the judge said, well, this is not in our jurisdiction. we, you know, this probably should be referred to another foreign court, but we'd have no information to help you with that. So they kind of admit it's not theirs, but they still give us problems. there's no, I know we'll get into this a little bit further into the interview.

But there's basically no one to tell them no. There's no greater entity with a monopoly of force to tell them no. You can't do this. used to be part of Serbia back in the day. Serbia has renounced any claim to Liberland. Croatia renounces any claim to Liberland because they want a much larger ⁓ area of land, which happens to be on the other side of the river. that's why neither country

wants the land that we call Liberland. But still there's some complications with use of force and who's the bully in the region and it turns out they can do it because they can and they have the guns. But we're still there. They still allow us to go there. You can go there and spend the night. You can spend seven nights. You can come in and out. You do have to show them your passport because you're leaving Croatia.

Rick Becker (10:54)
Gotcha.

Right.

Tom Walls (11:20)
They've established basically a de facto border crossing, right? And so you have to show their border police your passport, which is great because it establishes that there is a border between Liberland and Croatia.

Rick Becker (11:21)
Sure, right there.

Yeah.

Yeah.

If Liberland was Croatia, you wouldn't have to show your passport when you leave Liberland to go to Croatia. It's pretty simple. Yeah, I like that the I envision a thriving community some years down the road, freedom and prosperous. I like that you'll always be able hopefully to say that the longest standing structure in Liberland is a beach bar. And so I kind of enjoy that. Now you have I think

Tom Walls (11:39)
Exactly,

Rick Becker (12:01)
three quarters of a million people who have applied for citizenship is that somewhere in that area and of those how many have you accepted?

Tom Walls (12:06)
That's correct. There

are people from every single country in the world who have applied for liberal land citizenship, including North Korea. ⁓ Yes, there are some people with internet access in North Korea, and some of them have applied for liberal land citizenship. Now, that's a lot of people. Three quarters of a million is quite a few people. They could probably physically fit in liberal land, but I don't think that's the way it's going to go.

Rick Becker (12:29)
Yeah.

Tom Walls (12:35)
There are about 1,000 people who have Liberland citizenship. A number of them have passports, and some of them use their passports. ⁓ It's not intended for travel right now, but it is accepted by about a little over a dozen countries in international travel. El Salvador actually accepted our passport in advance. ⁓ So when we sent a delegation there a couple years ago, they actually

accepted our passport when we flew into the San Salvador airport. Yeah, we also have, in addition to citizenship, we have the e-residency program. It's kind of like a first step to becoming a Liberlander. ⁓ You can sign up on our website and become an e-resident. It's kind of inspired by the Estonian e-residency program where you can

Rick Becker (13:09)
that's fantastic.

Tom Walls (13:28)
get your Liberland e-residency, you can open a business in the Liberland ecosystem, and we're trying to add some more benefits to make it more attractive for people. Of course, people who support our idea are very eager to become e-residents and citizens, but we're thinking of adding some more value to people actually signing up and becoming e-residents, becoming citizens.

Rick Becker (13:51)
Yeah, very cool. Was not aware of that. ⁓ Back to El Salvador. So I think that's certainly ⁓ hope gives hope inspires one to think that that maybe will be something that continues with momentum in other countries. And I think El Salvador and Liberland share the the appreciation of cryptocurrency. ⁓ Are you do you expect or do you hope to get official recognition?

⁓ from El Salvador or any other country soon and then I'll just lead further. Do you have hope and maybe it's already been happening talks with Javier Milei in Argentina because that that seems primed. mean, Liberland is right up his alley with with you know, Austrian economics and so forth.

Tom Walls (14:40)
He's already a fan and our people have met with him on occasion. I actually wrote him a letter before he was elected president. And when he was a Congressman in Argentina, just complimenting him on the work he's done over there. And we've got a lot of support in Argentina. We've sent two delegations. We attended his presidential inauguration. We ran into him at the Trump inauguration back in January.

Rick Becker (14:42)
Yeah.

Tom Walls (15:10)
and he was so happy to see us. you know, our people have met with him a number of times and we're continuing our dialogue with the Javier Milei's government. ⁓ We actually are pretty good friends with his former foreign minister, Diana Mondino, who told us, hey, we'll be the first big country to recognize Liberland. She told us that. ⁓

She it's a little they have a new foreign minister. He's going to it's going to be a It's going to take a little bit more work to get those formal diplomatic overtures on the table, but we're in dialogue with with Argentina and that's very encouraging ⁓ and there's something ⁓ We may be going there again very soon ⁓ for something very special I'm not going to talk about it right now, but ⁓

there may be another Argentina delegation going down there. And we're working with other countries as well, other countries in Latin America, Caribbean, Africa, some other European nations. Actually, we had a delegation just come back from ⁓ an Asian nation, which is fairly large. And we met the president and prime minister there and also one of the biggest entrepreneurs in the country who's building smart cities.

over there and he's totally into Bitcoin, totally into new technology and blockchain governance and things like that. we're talking with people in a number of countries, not just El Salvador or Argentina, but with others as well. We've got a delegation going down to a Caribbean country this week. ⁓ And ⁓ actually, let me, you know, in addition to our global outreach, we're also concentrating on our neighbors.

We have pretty good relations with Serbia, of course. They haven't explicitly come out and said people should recognize Liberland, but they've certainly ⁓ tolerated us ⁓ to a great degree, where the Croatians have not. So we're thankful for that. Go ahead.

Rick Becker (17:22)
it's it's it seems like it would be

in Serbia's best interest to recognize you because Croatia wants to further take land beyond Liberland from Serbia if I have that right. So I would think like they jump on board and say yes, Liberland it's real.

Tom Walls (17:33)
Yeah.

Yeah, well, they certainly ⁓ deal with us fairly and we're very appreciative of that. I think if some of the things we tried to do on the Croatian side that we do in Serbia, they'd probably, you know, at least interrogate us. ⁓ So I think we have a good relation, good working relationship with Serbia. They know that we want to bring benefits to the region. want to bring employment, tourism, investment. We actually have a regional development.

plan, which will benefit both sides of the river. We've got some projections and studies that we had done not too long ago that would demonstrate that our investment in a thriving Liberland and our free trade zone would certainly ⁓ bring up the local GDP by a couple of points even if we were really fully allowed to develop like we want to. ⁓ And we're getting some actual interest on the Croatian side as well.

One of the challenges is that they're, and I want to be careful what I say here, their intelligence services have positioned themselves in opposition to Liberland. ⁓ We certainly don't want any kind of hostility or antagonism with them. We also want to convince them that we can make this a win-win situation. We can hire Croatians. We can help develop their infrastructure. We can invest in nearby cities that have seen a drain

of people over the last 30 years. And they know that. They know they've lost people to emigration because there's no jobs there. When Yugoslavia broke apart and when they went to war, Croatia and Serbia, ⁓ it was basically a region that was dying after the war ended. A lot of people just left their region. They went to the coast where there's some jobs and tourism and hospitality.

Rick Becker (19:27)
Hmm.

Tom Walls (19:30)
Some of them left the country. They went to Germany or other countries. They came to the United States or Canada or UK. ⁓ There's basically no jobs there. We want to turn that around. We can bring jobs there. And we have people who are interested in investing in the region. ⁓ We just need to get through to decision makers on the Croatian side and convince them that it can be a win-win situation. We can bring benefits to them. ⁓ They kind of look at it through this old

rusty old lens that, you know, it's kind of a zero sum game. They think, well, you know, we're not taking away anything from them, but it sounds like to your average person who doesn't know the ins and outs of the border dispute, it sounds like, well, you could frame it like we're taking something away. We're not taking anything away. They don't even claim it for goodness sake. ⁓ So ⁓ I think we can, younger people are certainly more open to

Rick Becker (20:05)
Yeah.

Yeah.

Tom Walls (20:29)
our perspective and our arguments and the opportunities that we have. But the police and the law enforcement and the border cops are under orders to make things difficult for us. ⁓ So we want to turn that around. We want to reach to the people who are making those decisions and giving those orders and say, hey, you can benefit from this too. We don't want to play cat and mouse with you guys all the time.

We can build something that's great and we can even hire a lot of your people and they'd probably be paid better working for us. ⁓ Of course, you know, we don't want to lose sight of our goal. We do want to be a sovereign independent nation. But, you know, when it comes to Croatia, we found that's a little touchy. So, you know, we're presenting ourselves more as a community, a community of real people. You know, a lot of Europeans, Croatia is part of the EU.

Rick Becker (21:02)
Sure, of course. Of course.

Mm-hmm.

Tom Walls (21:24)
and a lot of the people who come to settle are from other European countries. So it's not like we're a bunch of foreigners coming in. Europe's had tremendous issues with migration over the past 10 years and even more. It's not like that at all. We're not seeking asylum there. We don't want to take jobs from anybody. We want to build something. We want to be productive. We want to create something that's beautiful and it's certainly in a beautiful area.

and Croatians and Serbians and Hungarians and other people are also invited to participate in that. So I like living over there. It's really fun. The people are very nice on both sides and I'm trying to learn the language a little bit. And I love the history and the culture and the food is great too. So it's very interesting living over there.

Rick Becker (22:13)
The so the premise of this podcast war, divorce or federalism federalism meaning decentralization ⁓ looks into all these aspects of how we'd be better off when we're more decentralized when the state is less of a hegemon. And so this Liberland plays into it beautifully. ⁓ Do you think

that some of these nations who are resistant to recognizing you are resistant because they're trying to play nice with the powers that be, or are they resistant because they recognize maybe I'm giving them too much credit, but because they recognize the threat to the type of existence they have as a state, when you've shown if you're permitted or if it succeeds, that a micro state can be tremendously both prosperous and free.

Tom Walls (23:04)
Yeah, I think it's a little bit ⁓ of all of that. ⁓ We do represent freedom and in the world today, most people are subject to a central authority. And being sovereign and being decentralized, that means you're not subject to some central authority. And in the European Union in particular,

A lot of the countries have, you know, expressed displeasure with the dictates that come out of Brussels. I mean, the UK, they got sick of it and they pushed through Brexit successfully, but they still trade and travel with the European Union. ⁓ You know, so you can have sort of a separation, but still having peaceful and prosperous relations. ⁓ The Czech Republic, used to be part of Czechoslovakia, but that split apart and it was 100 % peaceful.

You can have separation, can have ⁓ parting of ways, but do it completely peacefully. And we want to show that you can do that. We don't want to be part of the EU, but we definitely want to have relations with the European Union and with other multilateral organizations. We just don't want to do it by force. ⁓ Now, you have one approach that some people in this space, they take, it's called, you

I'm sure you've heard of it, flag theory, which says, you know, plant your flag in different jurisdictions, diversify your assets, your business and your residences just to take the most advantage of what's out there. In other words, you spend time where you're treated the best and multinational corporations have been doing that for a long time, actually. So, ⁓ but you know, our approach is a little different. We want to create our own sovereign state and we want to make it attractive for people to plant their flag there.

Rick Becker (24:46)
Mm-hmm.

Tom Walls (24:56)
We have no laws against dual citizenship or triple citizenship. A lot of our people have multiple passports. I still have a US passport, of course. But this is a way to separate peacefully, but still retain all the advantages of being part of a larger polity. I think, go ahead. Now you go ahead,

Rick Becker (25:17)
Yeah, how does the go ahead?

The the so we're again back to the premise of the podcast, we're looking at the possibility if we can't decentralize adequately, we don't gain our freedoms and so forth, we'd be looking at a national divorce or secession. And it could be single states could be groups of states and so forth. The model that Liberland has is an opt in citizens ⁓ who are

Tom Walls (25:40)
Yes.

Rick Becker (25:42)
citizens are citizens because they wanted to be citizens. They, you know, if you go to back to John's lock, John Locke's social contract, right, that's effective. They're like, hell yeah, I want to be part of Liberland. Is there is there anything from that model that do you that you think let's just say Texas, for example, because if they were to secede, you know, they definitely want to be alone, not with a group of states. Do you see that they can apply that opt in mentality somehow if they were to attempt secession?

Tom Walls (26:10)
Yeah, think they could. Who knows, may Texit may be a real thing at some point. ⁓ I was just, we were both just out in California and it was very interesting. There's so much, even though it's like, it feels like a separate country, even though there's so much of California in America and vice versa, there's so much of America in California, but you can feel it. It feels like a different country.

But it was totally cool and everybody was nice, but you could be separate and peaceful. I had a great time out there. And ⁓ I think that to using that approach where, you you're not part of this larger polity anymore, but you still get along. I think that's a good way to go. And I think, you know, we have some states like, you know, New Hampshire, Texas, Florida, you know, they've asserted a great.

degree of independence from the federal government and trying to resist federal mandates, be it an education or some other policy. I think if we respect the 10th Amendment in the United States, those powers that are not explicitly given to the federal government or reserved to the states or the people, as long as we follow the 10th Amendment, there's less pressure to secede. But sometimes when you have

a bunch of people who are determined to inflict their rules upon you, then maybe national divorce is the best way and the best solution when dealing with those people who want to inflict all that stuff on you. Now, there's costs to that too, and it can be painful, but my view is it doesn't have to be violent. I think the notion of a civil war is a little bit fantastic. It's a bit of a fantasy, even though there was a civil war in the United States before.

and there's been civil wars all over the world, it doesn't have to be violent. Like I said, in the EU, the UK voted to leave the EU and it was completely peaceful and we still have people from the UK all over and they just don't pay taxes directly to the EU anymore and the EU has no political control over the UK, which is a win. I think

Rick Becker (28:24)
Yes.

Tom Walls (28:25)
And some of the countries in Europe, want to join the EU because they know they're going to get a lot of money from Brussels. They get money from Brussels anyway. Serbia is not a member of the EU, and a few other countries are not members, but they still get a lot of money from Brussels. So if they complete the accession, which is like a very long and complicated process, they get even more. So that's why some of the countries, the poorer countries, want to join up.

with the EU. I hope that doesn't happen in Serbia. I hope they retain their independence. Switzerland has maintained their independence. They've remained outside of the EU. ⁓ There's a few other examples which are pretty interesting.

Rick Becker (29:10)
The the

Is there any hope if Croatia just decides to do a takeover by force bring in the military? Do you have a body? Maybe International Court of Justice, some some body that you could appeal to? Or do you think it's game over at that point?

Tom Walls (29:35)
No, there was things that we can do. You know, we don't really like as libertarians We don't really like that the UN but there are mechanisms to turn to when There is something that is unfair or unjust Happens I don't believe they would send in the military the the Erdut agreement which I believe was signed in 1995 or around then

prohibits both Croatian Serbia from stationing military forces in the border area. But they do use their border police and the forest administration people to come in and make things more difficult for us. So I don't see the military threat there. ⁓ Again, on the Serbian side, there is a military base not too far from us, but they're not allowed to approach the border area or the river. That's totally forbidden. ⁓

Luckily, it's not like a China versus Taiwan type situation where China is a military threat to Taiwan, but what can you do about that? ⁓ We hope nothing happens there and we hope certainly ⁓ other countries don't get involved and try to intervene, but we hope for a peaceful solution in that. ⁓ I think there's some, since Croatia is a member of the EU,

⁓ Again, we don't like everything the EU does, but there are some mechanisms we can try to use to restrain Croatia's excesses of pushing our people around. Like they've detained people without charges, they've banned people from Croatia. ⁓ So I think there's some mechanisms in the EU to kind of hold Croatia in line. They're violating EU law. They're restricting EU citizens' freedom of movement.

and freedom to choose where to go when they joined the u when they join the shanghai zone they're supposed to give you free passage ⁓ but they in certain cases they've banned five or six people from the area usually people who take a leading role in the settlement of liberland just to get him out of the way you know when you target the leadership that ⁓ you know that certainly ⁓ makes things more challenging but they of course they still let they let people it

If you want to come down and visit, you can just cross the border. The day they opened the border, I spent eight days in Liberland, which is amazing.

Rick Becker (32:07)
Yeah, that's, that's very cool. Let me ask you now when when once Liberland is able to become more established, ⁓ get get a constitution implemented, if I understand correctly, there's one written a sort of a proto type constitution and ready to roll is, are we is that accurate?

Tom Walls (32:27)
We do have a constitution that's been through three iterations. The latest one is pretty good. I mean, it's still open to amendment. Basically, it's a fairly short constitution. It's one of the shortest ones in the world. I mean, there's pluses and minuses to that, but we feel it's fairly robust.

Rick Becker (32:30)
Okay.

Mm-hmm.

Tom Walls (32:49)
and it guarantees the rights of the citizens and it also ensures that citizens have a right to vote against legislation that the government passes. If the majority of people don't like something the government has done, they can reverse it. They can also vote out politicians or congressmen. They can also vote out judges. ⁓ So I think we retain a lot of power in the hands of the people.

Rick Becker (33:15)
Yeah, that's very, ⁓ that's enticing. And I was reading on that. And I was what struck me is, I found it so intriguing, because if it's in some respects, it's representative, you've got a parliament and other respects at almost at will a citizen can call a referendum, there's effectively a plebiscite for where everyone's voting to, to do what the people want. That's very much a democracy, which

Generally speaking, true democracy, would say is quite dangerous. However, ⁓ it sounds like it's voting based on token ownership. it may be that people with more in the game, more skin in the game have more voting. also correct me if I'm wrong, but if you're a welfare recipient, then you are not voting at that time. And now maybe, maybe those two things take care of

the concerns I have with the democracy, a true democracy, which has been said to be, ⁓ you know, two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for lunch. ⁓ What do you say about? Yeah, what do you say about that?

Tom Walls (34:21)
That's a good one. I like that.

Well, you know, again, we try to put safeguards in place to ensure that your fellow citizens don't vote money out of your wallet. You know, we cannot tax people. There's no mandatory taxes and you won't go to jail for not paying taxes because there are no obligatory ones. Now you can contribute voluntarily and the more merits you accumulate, the more weight your vote has. So it's a weighted voting system.

where if you've done a lot for the country, if you've contributed or worked a lot, then you have a lot of merits and you have a larger say ⁓ in the governance of the country. But everybody has one vote when it comes to vetoing something. We have the public veto. And if the majority of people don't like a person in office or if they don't like a law, they can rescind that through the plebiscite. And it's a pretty good system. And again, you can't vote to tax

your fellow citizens.

Rick Becker (35:25)
Okay. Yeah, that that well that would be key right there. I like that. Let's go back to the WDF in America kind of ⁓ view and your, your take. Thus far, you've said, you know, decentralizing federalizing sounds favorable war sounds just impossible and not even a consideration to maybe concern ourselves with too much.

Do you do you see a decentralized a true federal system as the founding fathers of the United States saw it as preferable to a more divided subunit sub nations that spring from the what would be then the former United States?

Tom Walls (36:10)
Yeah, and this is something we could talk about for a long time. there's always challenges to what extent can you decentralize, can you reject ⁓ a mandate from up above. And we talked a little bit about some of those states that who are rejecting those challenges and they're pretty successful. there's still challenges, there's other problems like Florida,

and other states, they have the problem of public pensions. Like there's a huge liability there on the part of these states. And, you know, that was from the old system, but they're still saddled with that. And we still have to pay for that in the long run. And you also have states that probably more left-leaning. In the last election, I remember what, like three states, they tried to take Trump off the ballot and it was a federal election. But that's those states asserting their

Rick Becker (36:48)
Mm-hmm.

Tom Walls (37:09)
independence, whether you agree with them or not. You've got places that are establishing sanctuary cities. Again, whether you agree with it or not, they're still asserting their own sovereignty. And they're saying that, well, this federal mandate doesn't apply here. And of course, there's conflict about that. One thing that is a little worrisome here, stateside to me,

Rick Becker (37:10)
Mm-hmm.

Tom Walls (37:38)
is the militarization of law enforcement. ⁓ And that kind of intimidates people not to assert their independence. And when it comes to God bless the boomers and silent generation and older folks in general, they were brought up to obey the government. If there was a government official, you'd follow their orders. I think

Rick Becker (37:42)
Mm-hmm.

Tom Walls (38:05)
During COVID, we saw a lot of people obey the government, but then you saw this core of people who started to resist that. So I think there's a bit of resistance to that. It's not uniform, it's not universal, but I think eventually the powers that be sort of gave up on all these mandates and lockdowns that they were trying to impose on people. They can only go so far before people get sick of it.

Rick Becker (38:33)
Yeah. So it sounds like you might be a fan for the US of decentralization or federalizing and that you like me thinks that the most likely route to successfully doing that is nullification from the states rather than hoping that somehow DC is going to offer it up.
